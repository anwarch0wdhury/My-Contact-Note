* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  notifies Observer objects when the lifecycle state changes.

* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.

* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
